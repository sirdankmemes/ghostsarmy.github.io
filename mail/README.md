# Easy Mail

**Easy Mail** is a **free PHP mail script** adding a simple mail form to web pages.

The script comes with a basic text captcha to limit SPAM and supports auto subject by calling it with a query string, e.g. `script.php?Test_Subject` Everything works from a single page, so no extra redirect is required. It can be used as a stand-alone mailer page or fully integrated into any existing pages, as long as the script is included before the form's mark-up.
