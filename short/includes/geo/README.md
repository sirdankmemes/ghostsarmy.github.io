========================

What the hell?
--------------

Text files from this package (GeoIP.dat and geoip.inc) are provided free by
MaxMind. Accuracy is 99.5% so don't sweat it if you get unrealistic results.

If unsure, you can always get the latest version of the GeoIP database
from the following URL: http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecountry
(look for a link pointing to files named "GeoIP.dat.gz" and "GeoIPv6.dat/gz")

Flag files from this package come from various sources. Feel free to copy and
redistribute them just as I'm doing :)
